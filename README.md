# Low Level Design (LLD) in C++

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains the Low Level Design (LLD) implementation of **Many Systems** using C++. The goal of this project is to showcase object-oriented design principles, SOLID principles, and a modular structure that aligns with real-world system architecture.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Well-structured class hierarchy
- Follows SOLID principles
- Modular and extensible design
- Implements core functionalities of Many Projects
- Written in modern C++ (C++11/14/17)

## üß± Design Principles Used

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
